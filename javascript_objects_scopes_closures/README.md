# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
Why JavaScript programming is amazing
How to create an object in JavaScript
What this means
What undefined means
Why the variable type and scope is important
What is a closure
What is a prototype
How to inherit an object from another

# Requirements
# General
Recommended editors: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
The length of your files will be tested using wc
You are not allowed to use var

# Tasks
# 0. Rectangle #0
mandatory
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class

# 1. Rectangle #1
mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

# 2. Rectangle #2
mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

# 3. Rectangle #3
mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

# 4. Rectangle #4
mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

# 5. Square #0
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
The constructor must take 1 argument: size
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

# 6. Square #1
mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
If c is undefined, use the character X
